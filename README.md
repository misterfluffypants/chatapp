## Troubleshooting

1. **Mobile cannot connect**

   * Ensure your phone and PC are on the **same network**.
   * Open the app using your PC‚Äôs **local IP**, not `localhost`.

2. **Video not working**

   * Ensure the browser allows **camera and microphone** access.
   * Some browsers may require HTTPS for WebRTC; local testing via HTTP works for most.

3. **WebSocket errors**

   * Verify that `app.js` uses the dynamic host:

     ```js
     ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${window.location.host}`);
     ```
   * Avoid hardcoding `localhost` if accessing from other devices.
